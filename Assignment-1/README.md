# Assignment-1

I am used to the Google Doodle series of mini-games, so when I saw the link for [Experiments with Google](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/search?q=WebGL), I was intrigued. What I found was much more than I had inticipated. It had games, fractals, strange physics sims, and my personal favourite, the [WEBGL Maze](http://www.spacegoo.com/maze). This strange maze befuddled me with its looping hip-hop soundtrack and its extremely strange iconography of Chuck Norris, the 2004 movie "Dogeball" starring Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller, and other randomly placed items, such as pictures of cats. Outside of my confusion at this particular experiment, I noticed just how many of the experiments where too old for me to run, or were destroyed, leaving no way to access them beyond their overviews. It was like walking through a graveyard of code.
