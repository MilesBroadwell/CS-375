Project Idea: A Duck Hunt inspired clicker-shooter, using models of grass, trees, something to shoot at, and a gun. Just like Duck Hunt, the gun and targets would be animated, and textures would be used to make all of the various models distinct. 

Week-by-Week plan:
  Week 1: Get Three.js installed and working, and find some importable models
  Week 2 (Thanksgiving Week): Finalise mechanics list and start implementation; Start implementation of Player input
  Week 3: Put together enviornment and have mechanics mostly implemented; import or create animations
  Week 4: Finalise implementations (polishing and debugging); create slideshow presentation

Technical Requirements:
  Three.js and JS
  Sketchfab
  If needed, Blender (for importing/creating animations)
